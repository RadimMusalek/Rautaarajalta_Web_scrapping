# Rautaarajalta_Web_scrapping

This is an assignment for my Interify course to practice web scrapping and data analysis. I picked a blog www.rautaarajalta.fi for this assignment. The website consists of several articles including both text, pictures and posting date. I scrapped the website and created a dataframe including the name of each article, its posting date, letter count, word count, amount of pictures and a link. Then I analysed the obtained values.

Tools used in this project:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly Express
- Matplotlib
- WordCloud
